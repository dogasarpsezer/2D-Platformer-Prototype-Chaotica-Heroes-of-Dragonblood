# 2D-PLatformer-Prototype
This a prototype 2D Platformer Game based on my hombrew D&D game. The world is Chotica (a world that I created). 
My purpose is to make the first chapter of the game as a demo and then find some crewmates for this journey. However,
making a project solo is taking time, and between community management, internship and another project me and a friend will do I currently
do not have the time to finish this prototype. However I am satisfied with the result, the prototype has:

1- A small Inventory System (One potion and One hammer)
2- Attack mechanics
3- Character Movement Mechanics
4- Player Statistic Mechanics such as Health, Stamina and Mana

Used Tools:
1- Unity Engine is used.
2- I used Blender is to make 3D Models, rendering them with low resolution gave me a pixel art style sprites.
