# 2D-PLatformer-Prototype
This a prototype 2D Platformer Game based on my hombrew D&D game. The world is Chotica (a world that I created). 
My purpose is to make the first chapter of the game as a demo and then find some crewmates for this journey.

Project:
1- Unity Engine is used.
2- Blender is used to make 3D Models and rendering them with low resolution to give a pixel art style.
